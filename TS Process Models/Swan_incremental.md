## Outline
To fulfill the contract we will outline loose metrics
+ A database capable of students, instrutors, and admin users
+ A database of courses containing:
  + CRNs
  + Course Name
  + Times
  + Instructor
+ 3 Types of users
  + Admin - can see and edit everything
  + Student - can register and see available classes and their own schedule
  + Instructor - can see available courses and their own course roster
  + Support multiple semesters and printing out of schedules and scheduling preferences
___
## Development
Once the metrics are outlined, a functional skeleton of the software will be created.
[]: # (Small gramatical edits for clarity - EH)

### Specification and Verification
During the original version's development a cyclical process of fleshing out the specification (such as user limits such as 100 students, 10 instructors, and 1 admin) and the verification of the following versions
[]: # (Added commas so it reads better - EH)
___
## Initial Version
This may be the simplest version, aiming to solve the original specifcations but as development was underway their may have been changes that will have to be added and improved upon in later versions.
[]: # (Small gramatical edits for clarity - EH)
___
## Intermediate Versions
Intermediate versions play the role of refining the original image and allowing the customer to shape their final product that they want while having many chances for the developers to input and aid in reaching the best final project.
___

## Final Version
After repeated and incremenetal development the final product should be a thoroughly vetted and refined final product.

[]: # (This is a good description of the steps of the incremental model, but you should try to give more of a description of how it might apply to this specific problem - EH)
