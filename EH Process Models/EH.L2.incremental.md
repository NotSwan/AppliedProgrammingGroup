## Outline Description
 - Database of users: the system must work for 100 students, 10 instructors, and 1 admin
 - Database of courses: this will contain information such as the CRN, course name, times, and instructor
 - Three types of users:
	- Student -  can register, can see available courses and their own schedule
	- Instructor – can see available courses and their own course roster
	- admin – can see everything, can edit courses, users, and schedules
 - The system should include multiple semesters, print-out of schedule, scheduling preferences
## Iterations
 - First Iteration
	- implement the basic database - tables of students, instructors, administrators, and classes
- Second Iteration
	- create functionality to add, view, and remove data from the database
- Third Iteration
	- create users and establish permissions as to what functionality from the second iteration they have access to
